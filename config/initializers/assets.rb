# Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.

# Version of your assets, change this if you want to expire all your assets.
Rails.application.config.assets.version = '1.0'

# Add additional assets to the asset load path
# Rails.application.config.assets.paths << Emoji.images_path

# Precompile additional assets.
# application.js, application.css, and all non-JS/CSS in app/assets folder are already added.

# ERB in js...
# The only reason to use Erb in a Javascript file should be to use the 'asset_path' helper as discussed in http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v4.2.0/asset_pipeline.html#javascript-coffeescript-and-erb.
# You might have to config assets for precompile with a '*.erb', but check out docs first????!!
# example:
# $('#logo').attr({ src: "<%= asset_path('logo.png') %>" });
